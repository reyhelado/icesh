# IceSH â€” A bit of a frozen shell

IceSH (Ice Shell) is a stupid idea of a simple customizable and protected shell.
It's just a dummy shell wrapped with protection layer handled by Ruby.

## Getting started

After you clone the repository, install dependencies with bundler:

  $ bundle install

Yeah, and that's it... Now you can enter into the shell by executing:

  $ ./icesh

There's nothing special to know about tests suite, run it with rspec rake task:
